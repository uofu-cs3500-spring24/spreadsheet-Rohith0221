# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating a formula and also validating if it's good or bad
Future extensions are using Graph to make it function as a cell in Spreadsheet program.Added a new GraphDependencyLibrary
to simulate cells like as in a spreadsheet establishing dependency between two cells.Changed the way validation is checked for formula
and now evaluates the result in doubles and accepts double type numbers.

# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment One:   Predicted Hours:          13        Actual Hours:   11

    2. Assignment Two:   Predicted Hours:          12        Actual Hours:   10

    3. Assignment Three : Predicted Hours:         15-20     Actual Hours:10-11  Comments: Took more time to understand the description as it's very vague

    4. Assignment Four  :  Predicted Hours:        16        Actual Hours:12-13

    5. Assignment Five  :  Predicted Hours:        16-18     Actual Hours:12-14

    6. Assignment Six   :  Predicted Hours:        20        Actual Hours:20-25

# Examples of Good Software Practices:

1. Had old tests from Assignment 4 rather than writing new tests that test out same functionality
   and fixed the code if any of tests broke

2. Abstraction: Already had a GetCellValue method to return the cell value that is in the cell class

3. DRY: For many methods,when a cell is to be validated against the rules given by the API,the helper method
   validateCellName validates it without repeating the same lines of code again and again throughout the Spreadsheet project

# Good Team Practices

Rohith V:

1. Respect each other's opinions and consider feedback from other person and try to continue to work in this manner throughout
   the assignment.Me and my partner have followed this policy and we were both always open to take in feedback from each other
   and in this way we continued to work on the assignment without any problems

2. Emphasize efficiency in meetings by having clear agendas, documenting action items, and respecting everyone's time.

Seongjin Hwang:

1. Time to review each other's code together. It was highly effective because we weren't focusing on the
   same project and waste time, but we decided to break the assignments into parts and be responsible for
   each part so we can make the progress faster. Although we faced some problems, but we were able to combine
   our parts and bring the assignment into one piece.

2. The area of team work I need to improve upon is trying to view the code from someone else's perspective. I 
   need to learn how to examine someone else's code from the perspective of the person who wrote it, not just
   from my perspective. I believe viewing our code with different perspective not only helps us to quickly figure
   out the problems is, but also improves our ability to analyze someone else code when it comes to the
   real world situations.
