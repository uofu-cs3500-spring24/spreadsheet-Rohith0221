# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating a formula and also validating if it's good or bad
Future extensions are using Graph to make it function as a cell in Spreadsheet program.Added a new GraphDependencyLibrary
to simulate cells like as in a spreadsheet establishing dependency between two cells.Changed the way validation is checked for formula
and now evaluates the result in doubles and accepts double type numbers.
